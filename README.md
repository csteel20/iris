<h2>Visual Issue Resolution for Quality Assurance</h2>

<p>The goal of this project is to provide a simple user interface for creating and resolving bugs in a development environment.</p>

<p>Removed the running server temporarily. The js is compiled using the command(s) below:</p>

```javascript
cake client:build
```
# # Development
<p>I have chosen to write the entire project in Javascript, using CoffeeScript. This will ideally keep the project easier to maintain. Additionally, it allows us to use the same language for the front-end user experience as well as the server requests via node.js.</p>
