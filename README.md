====
<h2>Visual Issue Resolution for Quality Assurance</h2>

<p>The goal of this project is to provide a simple user interface for creating and resolving bugs in a development environment.</p>

```javascript
var server = new IRISServer();
server.start(80);

```
# # Development
<p>I have chosen to write the entire project in Javascript, using Microsoft's Typescript. This will ideally keep the project easier to maintain. Additionally, it allows us to use the same language for the front-end user experience as well as the server requests via node.js.</p>
